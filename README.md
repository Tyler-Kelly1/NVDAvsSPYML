# Using Machine Learning to draw correlation between NVDA and SPY in 2024



If you were on finicae bro social media in 2024 there is a good chance to saw the meme or similar memes to the one below.

While this is clearly a hyperbole and not meant as truth, I couldnt help by wonder, what if it was true?

Thats when I decided that I would put this idea to test using machine learning and market data from the past year. My plan was simple. Using machine learning could I feed NVDA's data into a model to predcit the price of SPY with a reasoanble accruacy. Obviously me expectations for accruacy were quite low, but I was pleasently suprised by my results.

My whole process is walked through with mark up and comments in my 'main.ipynb' notebook.
